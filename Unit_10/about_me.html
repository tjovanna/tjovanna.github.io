	<!-- <h3>About Me</h3> -->
		<p>Oh hello there! Pleasure to meet you! I'm a photographer/painter/fledgling graphic designer/wishful astrophysicist/jell-o enthusiast. I have other skills, too. Ask me about them! For example, I made this website. (So you really know I'm not a one trick pony.)<br>
		<br>
		I studied photography and life histories at Bard College at Simon's Rock, where I became fascinated by quotidian drama and the complexity of nostalgia. I like to think I'm working to find the beauty of the everyday while acknowledging the mundane. I've also spent some time at the Salt Institute for Documentary Studies in Portland (ME) and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. <br>
		<br>
		I currently live in Cambridge (MA), where I curse the cold winters but stay for the crunchy autumn leaves (see, there's that nostalgia creeping in again).
